GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

POST is used to create new resources

PUT is used to replace an existing resource with the data provided in the request. 
    If the resource doesn't exist, it can be created. 

HEAD is similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers of the response, not the body. 
    Useful for checking resource availability or metadata. 

DELETE is used to remove a resource.
